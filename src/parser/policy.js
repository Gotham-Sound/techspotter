Signal 1: non-upright (rotated) runs strip unconditionally; screenplay body text is never rotated. Signal 2: repeated-position text strips when the same trimmed word sits in the same quantized cell (bucket = floor(coordinate / repeat_grid_pt), coordinates = the word's lower-left corner in spec section 3.5 anchor space, bottom-left origin, points, after any extractor boundary transform) on at least max(repeat_min_pages, ceil(pages * repeat_page_fraction)) of the document's PDF pages; candidate words then group per page by y-bucket and the group strips only if its joined text contains a lowercase letter. All-caps structure (cues, slugs) and single capital letters therefore never strip; the single-glyph cue gate keeps its territory (the S doctrine). Trailing-page-token exemption (issue #16 golden STOP, finding 1): a candidate group whose line's rightmost word on that page is a printed-page token (optional letter, digits, optional letter, period; e.g. '6.', '6A.') is a running header and never strips, however it repeats; the printed-page contract is load-bearing and headers are parseable furniture, not burn-in. Interpreters additionally read printed page numbers from PRE-strip lines so the contract never depends on any strip rule. Arithmetic is pinned to the letter because it is the cross-language cliff: floor is the only quantizer Python and JS mirror exactly (round() is banker's, Math.round is half-up), and anchor space keeps mixed-page-size documents from disagreeing about 'same position'.
